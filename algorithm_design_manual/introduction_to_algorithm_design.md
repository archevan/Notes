# Section One: Introduction to Algorithm Design
> An algorithm is a procedure to accomplish a specific task.

- We (as engineers) look for three things in a good algorithm. It should be *correct*, *efficient*, and *easy to implement.* Sometimes, all of these can't be achieved but we can find an algorithm that's "good enough."

- An *algorithm* always produces a correct result, whereas a *heuristic* typically provides a result that's good enough with no guarantee to always produce the correct result. There may be edge input cases that produce sub-optimal behavior.(Ex. Traveling Salesman Problem) 

- Algorithms that look "reasonable" can easily be incorrect. It's important to show that your algorithms are correct. 

---

- Algorithms can be expressed in *pseudocode*, *actual code*, or *English.* 
	- Each has its own trade-offs between "ease of expression" and precision
- Use whichever as long as you are **clearly** expressing the idea behind your
  algorithm.
